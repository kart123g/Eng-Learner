Abstract



In this we will build a Eng Learner website or user interactive  . It provide a easy way to learn your English language more reliable and improve . It improves user language speaking in this pandemic . This website provide more information about learning .It’s   a way to learn new language and upskill their languages .
This website provides more information about learning new language . This is most demanding in this pandemic and after ,because it’s a learning process that never end . 

Introduction




1.1 General Introduction to the topic
To build a Eng Learner website ,it’s a provide a easy way without any signup and sign in and without any advertisement . It’s uses simple and easy frequent method to learn . This website a way to learn and build your language .  
technology is blockchain. We have abstracted the application from the blockchain using a REST API that could support multiple channels such as web and mobile, and we provided block notifications via a standard WebSocket protocol.


For a test network to simulate this application on a decentralized architecture, the next step would be to add more members to the Fabric network and have those members provision peers that join the same channel.
About Eng Learner: -
It’s  a  website  that provide a easy way to learn a language.
How Eng Learner Works: -
It’s work on python language ,we build interactive with user so use HTML and CSS and according to uses .


It’s  uses pyaudio library and audiodiff  library in python 2.7. 


PYAUDIO :-
It work to read audio or input audio files.

AUDIODIFF :-

It work to show difference between two audio. 


1.3	Hardware Requirements
•	Memory [4GB RAM (or higher)]
•	Intel core i3 64-bit Processor (or higher)





1.3	Software requirements

•	Any OS
•	Pyaudio Library
•	Jupiter Notebook
•	Anaconda
 
Objective
The main objectives of the creating the Eng Learner, you deploy a three-tier application or website  that  easily learn English language . It’s helps people to learn without spend any amount ,because it’s ad free and easily understand and prounication of word .








Implementation Details



Part 1 :-

It’s important to go some research to implement some python libraries.

Part 2 :-

In this we design their input process of audio and then apply comparison python library

Part 3 :-

We create this user interactive .
